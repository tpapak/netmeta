for all designs or only a sensible subset (see Details).}

\description{
This function creates a net heat plot, a graphical tool for
locating inconsistency in network meta-analyses.
}
\details{
The net heat plot is a matrix visualization proposed by Krahn et
al. (2013) that highlights hot spots of inconsistency between
specific direct evidence in the whole network and renders
transparent possible drivers.

In this plot, the area of a gray square displays the contribution
of the direct estimate of one design in the column to a network
estimate in a row. In combination, the colors show the detailed
change in inconsistency when relaxing the assumption of consistency
for the effects of single designs. The colors on the diagonal
represent the inconsistency contribution of the corresponding
design. The colors on the off-diagonal are associated with the
change in inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a
network estimate in the row after relaxing the consistency
assumption for the effect of one design in the column. Cool colors
indicate an increase and warm colors a decrease: the stronger the
intensity of the color, the greater the difference between the
inconsistency before and after the detachment. So, a blue colored
element indicates that the evidence of the design in the column
supports the evidence in the row. A clustering procedure is applied
to the heat matrix in order to find warm colored hot spots of
inconsistency. In the case that the colors of a column
corresponding to design \eqn{d} are identical to the colors on the
diagonal, the detaching of the effect of design \eqn{d} dissolves
the total inconsistency in the network.

The pairwise contrasts corresponding to designs of three- or
multi-arm studies are marked by '_' following the treatments of the
design.

Designs where only one treatment is involved in other designs of
the network or where the removal of corresponding studies would
lead to a splitting of the network do not contribute to the
inconsistency assessment. By default (\code{showall = TRUE}), these
designs are not incorporated into the net heat plot. If
\code{showall = FALSE}, additional designs with minimal
contribution to the inconsistency Q statistic are not incorporated
(i.e., designs with \code{abs(Q.inc.design)} \code{<=}
\code{.Machine$double.eps^0.5)}.).

In the case of \code{random = TRUE}, the net heat plot is based on
a random effects model generalised for multivariate meta-analysis
in which the between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2} is estimated by the
method of moments (see Jackson et al., 2012) and embedded in a full
design-by-treatment interaction model (see Higgins et al., 2012).
